# Orthodontic-growth-in-children-analyzed-using-Mixed-Effect-and-Random-Coefficient-Models.

Children's orthodontic growth patterns have long piqued the interest of researchers and practitioners, as knowing these patterns can help enhance treatment planning and outcomes. The goal of this study is to fit and compare several linear mixed-effect models and random coefficient models to the growth curves of orthodontic measurements in children. For this project, we will use a dental dataset obtained by researchers at the University of North Carolina Dental School, which records the growth of 27 children aged 8 to 14 (16 boys, 11 girls). 

The dataset measures the distance between the pituitary and pterygomaxillary fissures, two plainly recognizable spots on x-ray exposures of the side of the head, every two years (at ages 8, 10, 12, and 14). 

The purpose of this study is to examine the growth trajectories of these dental parameters in children and look for potential differences between males and females. Our major goal is to determine the best statistical model for defining the growth patterns found in the dental dataset. To accomplish this, we will fit three different types of models for each of the following subject groups: male subjects, female subjects, and the combined dataset. Through this comprehensive analysis, we hope to obtain a better knowledge of children's orthodontic growth patterns, identify any qualitative differences between males and females, and develop a strong statistical model for orthodontic research.
